## General Information
This project is to build a Linear Regression model for a Bike Sharing Company which wants to predict the demand of the bikes based on various factors.

## Technologies Used
- python
- pandas
- sklearn
- statsmodels

## Conclusions
- The model is built for which the r2 score of training data set is 77% and for testing data is 75.1%
- The linear equation can be given by : `cnt = 0.3629 +  0.248 * yr + 0.061 * workingday - 0.159 * windspeed + 0.093 * clear - 0.230 * light rain/snow + 0.068 * fall - 0.230 * spring + 0.067 * mon + 0.059 * oct + 0.072 * sep`
